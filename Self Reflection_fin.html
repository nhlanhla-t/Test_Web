									<p>Working on this project helped me to identify my weakness of being intimidated by tasks then deferring undertaking them as a result. I expected setting up my Github site to be difficult and so deferred it till the last minute. I did not have any prior experience with working with Github and so saw learing to use it as a daunting task.  The fact that Github and Visual Studio, the text editor I installed, have very information dense user interfaces made the learning curve seem more challenging. I also saw a strength coming to the fore in that my willingness to learn allowed me to take on the task of learning a new web user interface development framework (Streamlit), as well as learning a messaging framework (RabbitMQ), which I had never worked with before.  The project also entailed building code that worked with an LLM.  This was a key learning point for me in that I learnt how difficult it is to build an application around the output of an LLM, as this is constantly changing, in was that are impossible to predict. </p>
