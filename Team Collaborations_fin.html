									<p>The most significant team exercise that the team undertook was developing the team project. Working collaboratively virtually, as a team of people with full-time jobs proved to be challenging.  The different software development skill levels within the team proved to be both an advantage and a challenge.  The advantage was that some team members had a wider exposure to tools that could be used for the project, familiarity and confidence with UML tools and ability to conceptualise the solution architecture.  The challenge was that some of the team members work experience led to friction around leadership of the team.  </p>
									<p> The team met on Whatsapp and on Google Meet as those were the platforms that were accessible without requiring subscription</p>
									 <p>The team initially had some difficulty around co-ordinating times, but as the deadline for the project drew nearer, this improved
									 A need emerged to assert the team's decision with regars to the chosone project implementation after one of the team members 
									 felt that the  project should be changed baseed on their experience about similar initatives.  However eventually agreement 
									 was reached and the project proceeded.</p>
